        <h1>Hiking Companion</h1>
        <p>
        The Hiking Companion is your guide on your trips no matter if they are
        long or short, city trips or hikes. At first, there are no hikes available
        but you can record your own trips with this application. However, there are
        trips available on the playstore which can be installed. Currently the
        following are available;
        <ul>
          <li>SufiTrail: An ancient trail from Istanbul to Konya</li>
          <li>SultansTrail: A hike from Vienna to Istanbul</li>
          <li>HaarlemTrips: City trips in and around Haarlem North-Holland,
              Netherlands</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The program is easy to work with. A few buttons on top of every page
        and a menu to select more pages.
