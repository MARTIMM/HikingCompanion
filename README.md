# HikingCompanion Mobile Application

## Purpose
Purpose of this app is to have a companion program suitable for showing tracks and additional information about those tracks. It is the intention to get those tracks from other app installations or from your own recorded tracks and added pictures and notes. So this program would become an all purpose vehicle for displaying external tracks. While its name would suggest that long walks are intended, a city walk showing the hot items of that place would equally be possible.

At first use, not much can be done with the program. Another app must be installed too. This is a specially designed app holding track data and extra information such as notes and photos. Then, when such an app is installed, the app can be referred to by using some sort of name from this HikingCompanion application. The trail apps should always have a name starting with **HC-**. E.g. HC-Sufitrail or HC-Sultanstrail. This makes it possible to let the HikingCompanion look around on the device for these track apps.

When the HikingCompanion is not installed yet, the installation process of a tracking app should also install the HikingCompanion app.

A tracking app should hold any or all of the following data
* The route of the walk.
* Notes about interesting features along the route in several languages.
* Pictures showing the environment of points on the route.
* Map tiles and feature cache information.
* Places to eat and/or stay and web addresses to make reservations.
* Color palette and other makeup for this particular route.

## History
This mobile app is a re-try of the previously developed SufiTrail app where I stumbled upon problems using the methods at hand. After some searches and some good suggestions from a good friend of mine, a new setup is tried with `Qt` using the tool `qtcreator`.

I am still working through some series of acceptance tests but it looks hopeful. Below, a series of acceptance tests needed for this app and also the development for the implementation of the app is shown.

## License
Something public domain and risk free (for me that is ;-)

## Installing
This app will be placed in the app store when ready.


## Acceptance tests for this project
Below, there are a series of tests which is also used as the progress in the learning curve I have to go through. The most important device to work for are android devices. Ios devices would be nice but is a later problem.

<progress max=47 value="34" />

* [x] Android SDK, NDK and OpenJDK installation using Android Studio and linux installation tools.
* [ ] Xcode for ios
* [x] Configuration of qtcreator.
* [x] Setup devices for android
* [x] Setup devices for ios
* Run a few examples
  * [x] Build and run an example for the desktop
  * [x] Build, upload and run an example for an android device
  * [ ] Build, upload and run an example for an ios device

* QML Gui

  * [x] Build, upload and run this GUI on android device
  * [ ] Build, upload and run this GUI on ios device

  * [x] Organizing qml files in directories using qml.qrc. This can be done mostly automatic from within the creator but using the editor is sometimes easier.
  * [x] Organizing other files like images and docs are set using another `.qrc` file to make a different resource.
  * [x] Stylesheets. Starting project with `Application -> Qt Quick Application` cannot cope with the commands `QApplication->setStyle()` and `QApplication->setStyleSheet()`. The first could only be done via comandline arguments **-style** or manipulating the arguments list in the program. However creating a new project using `Application -> Qt Widgets Application` let the commands work. Also it was possible to include QML components into the widget structures be it a bit difficult. Other ways of styling are now implemented.

  * Input processing.
    * [x] Text input and show input
    * [x] Html or Rich text
    * [x] Scroll and wrap text
    * [x] Toolbar and normal buttons and processing
    * [ ] Other gui items like radio and check buttons, lists, tables etc.
    * [x] Make use of javascript for processing of events

  * Navigation. There are several implementations possible
    * [x] Show a menu. This is done using a `Column` component wherein `Button` components are placed.
    * [x] Multipages. Pages are created in separate files using a simple `Rectangle` component.
    * [x] Selecting pages from the menu.

* Integration of QML and C++. See for info [here][qtc-c++].
  * [x] Create a class with some variables and methods using <QObject> and other external modules.
  * [x] Use the class in a QML description.
  * [x] Debugging using qDebug() and using <QDebug>.
  * [ ] Controlling UI components from C++.

* File I/O and directory manipulations
  * [x] Go into an existing directory using QDir

  * [ ] Create, test and delete a directory using QDir
  * [ ] Build a directory tree using QDir

* Sharing data
  * [ ] Share data between one app and another on Android.
  * [ ] Share data between one app and another on IOS.

* XML processing to read and write qpx data and configuration files.
  * [x] Read and process an XML file. See also [this doc][qtc-xml].
  * [ ] Create an XML DOM tree
  * [ ] Save XML from DOM tree

* Map processing

  * [ ] Language switching using QLocale. See also Resources.
  * [x] Android manifest
  * [x] Desktop icon
  * [ ] Desktop widget


# Progress of the application
Next, the developing progress is shown here. Several entries are also in the acceptance tests to see if those things are possible because the purpose of the acceptance tests are to find out what Qt and the qtcreator tool is capable of.

## Events and devices to listen to
<progress value="0" max="7" />

There are several events which occur upon changing conditions in a device. These events must be captured for further actions.
* [ ] Battery condition to warn user of battery low state. App might dim display or perform other actions to save energy.
* [ ] Gps information to get current location.
* [ ] Network on and off line mode to update map and feature cache as well as send user data to a server
* [ ] Device compass to show map correctly pointing the map-north to the real north.
* [ ] Resize events to change from portrait to landscape mode and back. Responsive. Needed to display everything in proper sizes.
* [ ] Camera to add a picture as a point on the map when saved.
* [ ] Time and clock.

## Caching

Caching of data is needed for those moments that there is no network available.

<progress value='0' max='4' />

* [ ] At start up and network is on and a track is installed, caching must start. Caching must be inhibited when network is off or very slow.
* [ ] Store data (like date and time) to check for revisiting the caching process.
* Tile caching.
  * [ ] Make caching process visible when done for the first time. This can be a long process. Low resolution tiles are cached for places such as the current location when it is off track. Make use of the cache information provided by the installed track app.
* Feature caching.
    * [ ] Cache features using the information provided by the installed track app.
* Try to get weather forecast and cache (short term) this information too.

## The Menu
<progress value="5" max="5" />

* [x] Added module for variables and styling
* [x] Pressing the menu button `‚ò∞` shown on the map or other pages, will open a pane from the side to show a menu of options. A click on an entry will show another page. When selecting an entry, the menu is closed and a page will appear.
* [x] Each page may have a button `üè†`üåê üåç to the map page. Pressing that will return to the map page.

* [x] Layout of menu.
* [x] Layout of all pages must be coherent and matching the pages and colors from the book.

## The pages of the application
A series of screen descriptions the application can show.

### Display on tablet screen
<progress value="0" max="2" />

* [ ] An icon must be designed
* [ ] A widget showing small part of a chart?

### Splash screen
<progress value="0" max="4" />

When starting the program, the app must show a splash screen with a nice hiking picture on it while the program gets ready in the background. When it is, the splash screen is removed.

  * [ ] Show a screen with a nice picture. Keep this displayed until everything is initialized. This provides for a better user experience.
  * [ ] Show a progress bar.
