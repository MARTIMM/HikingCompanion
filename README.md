# HikingCompanion Mobile Application

## Purpose
Purpose of this app is to have a companion program suitable for showing tracks and additional information about those tracks. It is the intention to get those tracks from other app installations or from your own recorded tracks and added pictures and notes. So this program would become an all purpose vehicle for displaying external tracks. While its name would suggest that long walks are intended, a city walk showing the hot items of that place would equally be possible.

At first use, not much can be done with the program except recording your own routes. Another app must be installed too. This is a specially designed app holding track data and extra information such as notes and photos. Then, when such an app is installed and run, that particular app places its data in the HikingCompanion applications environment. The next time the HikingCompanion app is started, it will notice the new data and will insert the data in the hike database. When the HikingCompanion is not installed yet the program will not install the data.

A tracking app should hold any or all of the following data
* Several tracks showing the hike.
* Notes about interesting features along the route in several languages.
* Pictures showing the environment of points on the route.
* Map tiles and feature cache information?
* Places to eat and/or stay and web addresses to make reservations.
* Color palette and other makeup for this particular hike.

## History
This mobile app is a re-try of the previously developed SufiTrail app where I stumbled upon problems using the methods at hand. After some searches and some suggestions from a good friend of mine, a new setup is tried with `Qt` using the tool `qtcreator`.

## License
Something public domain and risk free (for me that is ;-)

## Installing
This app will be placed in the app store when ready.

---
# Progress of the application
Next, the developing progress is shown here. Several entries are also in the acceptance tests to see if those things are possible because the purpose of the acceptance tests are to find out what Qt and the qtcreator tool is capable of.

## Events and devices to listen to
<progress value="1" max="7"></progress>

There are several events which occur upon changing conditions in a device. These events must be captured for further actions.
* [ ] Battery condition to warn user of battery low state. App might dim display or perform other actions to save energy.
* [x] Gps information to get current location.
* [ ] Network on and off line mode to update map and feature cache as well as send user data to a server
* [ ] Device compass to show map correctly pointing the map-north to the real north.
* [ ] Resize events to change from portrait to landscape mode and back. Responsive. Needed to display everything in proper sizes.
* [ ] Camera to add a picture as a point on the map when saved.
* [ ] Time and clock.

## Caching

Caching of data is needed for those moments that there is no network available.

<progress value='0' max='4'></progress>

* [ ] At start up and network is on and a track is installed, caching must start. Caching must be inhibited when network is off or very slow.
* [ ] Store data (like date and time) to check for revisiting the caching process.
* Tile caching.
  * [ ] Make caching process visible when done for the first time. This can be a long process. Low resolution tiles are cached for places such as the current location when it is off track. Make use of the cache information provided by the installed track app.
* Feature caching.
    * [ ] Cache features using the information provided by the installed track app.
* Try to get weather forecast and cache (short term) this information too.

## The Menu
<progress value="5" max="5"></progress>

* [x] Added module for variables and styling
* [x] Pressing the menu button <button>‚ò∞</button> shown on the map or other pages, will open a pane from the side to show a menu of options. A click on an entry will show another page. When selecting an entry, the menu is closed and a page will appear.
* [x] Each page, other than the map page, must have a <button>üåç</button> button, to go to the map page.
* [x] Layout of menu.
* [x] Layout of all pages must be coherent.

## The pages of the application
A series of screen descriptions the application can show.

### Display on tablet screen
<progress value="0" max="2"></progress>

* [ ] An icon must be designed
* [ ] A widget showing small part of a chart?

### Splash screen
<progress value="0" max="4"></progress>

When starting the program, the app must show a splash screen with a nice hiking picture on it while the program gets ready in the background. When it is, the splash screen is removed.

  * [ ] Show a screen with a nice picture. Keep this displayed until everything is initialized. This provides for a better user experience.
  * [ ] Show a progress bar.
  * [ ] Show text displaying the task it is executing

# To do
* The Plain qml page must have a status line at the bottom to show errors and other messages.
* The Map page could show zoom level, hike icon of current hike, length of selected track.
* 'Remove a track' must have a dialog window
* Refine themes for all hikes and HikingCompanion. No gradients.
* Info texts must have more space on the side. It is too close to the edge.
* Change color of route depending on type, walk (dark brown) or bike (blue).
